"""“Metathesis” is the transposition of letters in a word. Two words form a “metathesis pair” if you can transform one
into the other by swapping two letters, like converse and conserve. Write a program that finds all of the metathesis
pairs in the word list.

Hint: The words in a metathesis pair must be anagrams of each other."""
