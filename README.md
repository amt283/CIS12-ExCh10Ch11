# CIS-12, Chapter 10 & 11 Exercises

<h2>Exercise 10.11.2</h2>
My version and the instructor's are the same, more or less, though mine has the old version of value_counts that was 
improved on with new_value_counts(). 

<h2>Exercise 10.11.3</h2>
My version and the instructor's are the same, more or less, but the instructor's separates the value_counter and the 
has_duplicates function. However, I combined the two so that way the loop would stop counting values and return TRUE 
if anything went over the value of 1, so instead of two loops there'd only be one. So, for this reason, I think my 
version is a bit more efficient.
