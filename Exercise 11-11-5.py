"""In a previous exercise, we tested whether two strings are anagrams by sorting the letters in both words and checking
whether the sorted letters are the same. Now let’s make the problem a little more challenging.

We’ll write a program that takes a list of words and prints all the sets of words that are anagrams. Here is an example
of what the output might look like:

['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
['retainers', 'ternaries']
['generating', 'greatening']
['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']
Hint: For each word in the word list, sort the letters and join them back into a string. Make a dictionary that maps
from this sorted string to a list of words that are anagrams of it."""
