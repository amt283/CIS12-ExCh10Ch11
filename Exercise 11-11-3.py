"""Write a function called shift_word that takes as parameters a string and an integer, and returns a new string that
contains the letters from the string shifted by the given number of places.

To test your function, confirm that “cheer” shifted by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” shifted by 16 is “cubed”.

Hints: Use the modulus operator to wrap around from 'z' back to 'a'. Loop through the letters of the word, shift each
one, and append the result to a list of letters. Then use join to concatenate the letters into a string."""
